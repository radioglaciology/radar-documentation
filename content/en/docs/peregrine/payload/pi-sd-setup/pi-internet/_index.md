Most of the time, the Pi doesn't need an internet connection. There are, however,
a couple of cases where you may want some sort of a network connection to the Pi.

These are:
1. Downloading data from the Pi to a computer (requires a network connection but not internet)
2. Initial setup with cloud-init (requires internet)
3. Updating code by pulling from GitHub (requires internet)

## Setting up network interfaces

### With cloud-init (first-time setup)

The preferred way to setup network interfaces is by providing them in the
`network-config` file read by [cloud-init when first setting up the Pi]({{< ref "pi-sd-setup" >}}).

An example is shown below:

{{< readfile file="/static/cloud-init/network-config" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

The above configuration sets up a static IP over the ethernet interface. It
also configures `192.168.11.1` as the default gateway. This allows for sharing
an internet connection from a computer over this interface if desired.

The configuration also provides an SSID and password for a WiFi network. In practice,
we configure this to the settings for a phone hotspot that can be used to get
internet when WiFi is not otherwise available. This is also a simpler setup for
getting the Pi on the internet when needed.

### Reconfiguring with netplan

By default, network interfaces are configured with netplan. See
[the netplan documentation](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/)
for more details.

## Configuring your computer

If you're connecting to the Pi via a simple ethernet cable to your computer,
you'll want both configured with static IPs. The config file above will do this
on the Pi side. On your computer, you'll want to set a static IP of `192.168.11.1`
and a netmask of `255.255.255.0`. For example, your settings may look like this:

### Sharing internet from your computer

Sharing your computer's internet connection from one network interface to another
is a useful trick to get an internet connection for the Pi. This can be done
between any two network interfaces (i.e. from your WiFi connection to the Pi over
ethernet or from one WiFi card to a network created by a second WiFi card).

The Arch Linux wiki has useful instructions for configuring
[internet sharing on Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Internet_sharing).

To briefly summarize them:

1. Enable IPv4 forwarding: `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`
2. Setup NAT with iptables: (See note below if you have docker installed!)

```
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i net0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT
```

Where `wlan0` should be replaced with the name of the network interface on
your computer which is currently connected to the internet.

If you have docker installed on your system, it
[changes your default firewall settings](https://docs.docker.com/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/)
. As a result, you need to setup NAT slightly differently:

```
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i net0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT
```
